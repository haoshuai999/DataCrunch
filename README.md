### Pain points

* Time-consuming to find patterns in large datasets
* Very difficult for individuals with no prior data skills
* If you donâ€™t know much about statistics, you might analyze incorrectly 
* Microsoft Excel struggles with large datasets
 

### Our Solutions

* Users can upload large datasets to a cloud server with an option to make them public. No need for local storage
* Once a dataset is uploaded, our platform can quickly process each feature and generate context through:
	- Visualizations (histograms, etc.)
	- Statistical analysis/descriptive statistics (mean, median, etc.)
	- Highlighting of outliers, missing values
 

### Other Saas Solutions

* Tableau Online
	- It does not cater to novices, requires you to pull insights from the data. We want our service to do that automatically.
* Kaggle
	- Not optimized for personalized data exploration. A place to find hosted data rather than explore your own
* Datawrapper
	- Primarily for generating visuals, not designed for providing statistical analysis
 

### Estimated Market Size

* Our target audience is journalists who lack data literacy. There are roughly 49,700 journalists currently working in the United States according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
* Our market could expand to encompass any individual looking to perform simple data analysis.
